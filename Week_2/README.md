# ML ZOOMCAMP QUICK RECAP WEEK-2 (LINEAR REGRESSION)
1. Base Formula.<br>
In the first week we said that the base formula for machine learning is f(X) ≈ y.<br>
In regression, the formula is aX + b ≈ y.<br>
2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Errors)<br>
Used to calculate the accuracy of the model.<br>
3. Categorical Features.<br>
In general, linear regression just accept numerical features. How if we have a categorical features?<br>
The answer is we just need manipulate it to form One Hot Vector.<br>
4. Regularization. <br>
Used for manipulate the data to avoid identical columns, so we can invert the features matrix.
5. Model Tuning.<br>
We need to tune our model to get the best accuracy, one of the ways is we can tune the value of regularization.
